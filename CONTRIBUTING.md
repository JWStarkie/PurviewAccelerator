# How to contribute to Purview Accelerator

We're really glad you're reading this, it would be great to have your input to the project.

If you haven't already, find out more about [Azure Purview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/overview).

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, instead reach out in the [Discussions board](https://github.com/JWStarkie/PurviewAccelerator/discussions).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/JWStarkie/PurviewAccelerator/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/JWStarkie/PurviewAccelerator/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue:
  * [Feature Request](https://github.com/JWStarkie/PurviewAccelerator/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
  * [Bug Report](https://github.com/JWStarkie/PurviewAccelerator/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/JWStarkie/PurviewAccelerator/pulls) with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please ensure it includes a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include usage examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

* Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

``` 
> $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Discussions board](https://github.com/JWStarkie/PurviewAccelerator/discussions) and start writing code.
