# PurviewDemo

## Need to figure out:
* how to store credentials/managed identity to synapse
* how to pass parameter down to nested scripts
* how to do one click deployment


## Things to do:
* add synapse
* add copy pipeline from gen2 to synapse (link synapse and adf using credentials/managed identity)
* add synapse to purview (link synapse and purview using credentials/managed identity)
